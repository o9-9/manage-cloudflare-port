    <h3>a quik way to manage cloudflare port forwarding</h3>
</div>

<br><br>

## setup
first, setup cloudflare:

1. stop using windows, this doesn't work on windows
2. create a cloudflare account if you do not yet have one
3. add domain(s) to cloudflare if you do not yet have them
4. create and set up a tunnel in zero trust as described [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel)

then, download quik:

1. find the executable intended for your system in [dist](./dist)
2. download and run it

optionally, if you're on mac/linux, add it as an alias in your terminal for easier use:

1. identify the shell (`echo $SHELL`)
2. find the path to the quik executable you downloaded (`pwd` in the folder where it is located)
3. add `alias quik='/path/to/quik-executable'` to your shell config file:
    - mac: `~/.zshrc` for zsh or `~/.bash_profile` for bash
    - linux: `~/.zshrc` for zsh or `~/.bashrc` for bash

if you want to build quik yourself (builds on mac/linux only):
1. install [bun](https://bun.sh)
2. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/quik && cd quik`
3. build quik: `./build.sh`

## creating a cloudflare API key
this is needed for the program to start.

1. go to the [cloudflare account token page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens)
2. create one with the following permissions:

the summary should look like this:

3. put it into quik
